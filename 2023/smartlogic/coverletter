Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at SmartLogic. As an
experienced Elixir developer with a proven track record of delivering scalable and efficient
software, I am excited to bring my skills and expertise to your team.

Looking at my resume, you will see that I have had the opportunity to work in both fast-paced
startup and large corporate environments, gaining a range of valuable experience. At Driver
Technologies Inc, I was able to quickly onboard and produce my first feature within two weeks. I
have supported multiple internal clients via REST and GraphQL and managed critical production
operations. I have created a data ingestion and analysis API that enabled partners to add drive
data to our backend system for storage and analysis. This project opened a new line of business
and helped to acquire two new business customers.

Previously, at Lockheed Martin, I developed the automation of an end-to-end system for automated
torque wrench control and data tracking that spanned multiple business areas. I also developed a
data pipeline that automated compliance data capture for reporting to government clients, created
installation scripts, and increased quality and velocity of app development/deployments by
creating a CI/CD pipeline.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how
I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,

Rory Fahy
