Hi Laura,

Thank you for getting back to me. Yes, I do have experience in Elixir! I have been working with Elixir for 7 months at Driver Technologies Inc, a Series A startup. My projects have included building a Gateway API, improving internal reporting metrics, and developing a "Plant Trees" feature. I have become proficient in Elixir, Phoenix, Ecto, and ExUnit during my time at the company. I have been working professionally as a software engineer for almost 4 years and have experience in many other technologies as well.

I believe my Elixir experience and willingness to commute make me a strong candidate for the role. Please let me know if there is a way for me to move forward in the process.

I have attached a link to my resume for your reference.

I am very interested in the position and hope we can connect soon to discuss it further.

Best regards,
Rory Fahy
