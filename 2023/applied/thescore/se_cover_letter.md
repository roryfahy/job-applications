Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to submit my application for the Software Engineer position at theScore. I am
confident that I have the technical expertise and passion for building innovative products that
would make me a valuable addition to your team.

As I mentioned to Vincent in the Elixir slack, I regularly listen to the Elixir Mix podcast and it
is where I first heard of CQRS. It seems like a really good idea but sadly I have yet to use it in
a practical mannor. There are 2 places where I currently fall a little short of the job
description. They are CQRS and LiveView but am eager to learn both.

What interests me about theScore is your dedication to delivering a personalized and immersive
sports experience for your users. I have always been passionate about sports and technology, and I
find it compelling how theScore has merged both these worlds to create a platform that offers
real-time scores, news, and in-depth analysis to millions of sports fans across the globe. I am
drawn to your company culture of fostering innovation and creativity, and I believe that my skills
in software engineering align with theScore's vision of building cutting-edge products that drive
engagement and shape the future of how sports integrate into our everyday lives.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to
theScore's mission of transforming the sports media landscape through technology. I look forward
to discussing my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Rory Fahy
