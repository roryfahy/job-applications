At a high level, describe a time when you had to architect a scalable and maintainable software solution using Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView?

In my most recent role at Driver Technologies Inc., I was instrumental in creating a data ingestion and analysis API using Phoenix and Ecto that allowed partners to add drive data to our backend system for storage and analysis. This project was critical in opening a new line of business and securing two new business customers. While I have a keen interest in learning LiveView, as noted in my resume, the project primarily relied on Phoenix and Ecto for its completion. The system was designed to be scalable, catering to a growing number of users and data volume, and maintainable, with thorough documentation and a robust testing framework using ExUnit to ensure long-term reliability.

This is a highly collaborative role; between code reviews, paired programming, and working closely with other departments, we value constructive feedback. Describe what style of communication works best for you.

My optimal communication style is highly interactive and supportive, which serves me well in environments that require close collaboration. I particularly enjoy pair programming, as it allows for real-time knowledge exchange and fosters a culture of collective code ownership. My role at Lockheed Martin afforded me the opportunity to mentor junior engineers, translating complex technical concepts into actionable learning experiences. This mentorship extended to guiding them through our codebase, cultivating best practices, and nurturing their problem-solving skills. My ability to articulate technical details in business terms has been essential in my interactions with cross-functional teams, including C-suite executives, ensuring that project goals are aligned with business outcomes. This skill has been key in driving projects that resonate with both engineering teams and senior leadership.

How do you keep your skills sharp and stay engaged with the community?

I maintain a commitment to continuous learning and skill enhancement by attending industry conferences such as EMPEX in NYC. These events provide a great opportunity to network, share knowledge, and learn from the experiences of fellow Elixir enthusiasts. While I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, such as the Kaffy dashboard, my contributions have been modest, mostly providing feedback and suggestions to improve the project. These activities complement my professional experience and enable me to stay informed about the latest technological advancements, ensuring that I bring current and effective practices to my role.
