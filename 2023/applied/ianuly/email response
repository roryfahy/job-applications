Dear Laura,

Thank you for taking the time to review my application for the position at Ianuly Talent Accelerators. I appreciate your response and your consideration of my application.

I understand that the company is currently only accepting applications from candidates based in New York or those who are able to work hybrid in the company's SOHO location 2 days a week. However, I would like to express my interest in the position and my willingness to commute from New Haven twice a week.

I used to commute to NYC for my previous job and I really enjoyed it. I am confident that I can adjust to this arrangement and make it work. I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and contribute to the company's success.

Thank you again for your consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Rory

Hi, this is my second time applying for the position. Laura sent me an email explaining the job is hybrid and therefore I wouldn't be eligible due to my location. I wrote a reply explaining that I commuted to the city in a prior job and actually liked the train ride. I noticed that email however was a `no-reply` so I'm reaching out here again to see if I may be considered for the position.
